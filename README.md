# SantaSystem
SantaSystem is a mobile object framework primer.

DLLs that users built are sent to remote computers by 'Santa Clause Objects'. In remote computers, programs that hosts 'Santa Clause Objects' are Running. And then, 'Santa Clause Objects' execute these DLLs in the remote computers :)

In response to user's requests, user's DLLs are executed in parallel or sequential order.
